# Book of the Dead Renamer
Don't you just hate it that Book of the Dead's teleport options are named junk like "Lunch by the Lancalliums"?

This tiny plugin replaces the 5 teleport options within Book of the Dead (and Kharedst's Memoirs) to their in-game locations.

It's a trivial plugin that does no validation that they're on the correct item, but how many items have those silly names in a sub-menu?

Not done a RuneLite plugin before, so I attempted to vibe-code it with ChatGPT, but that gave an incorrect solution where it just kept renaming the "Reminisce" parent menu option, so I found this hackier solution.
